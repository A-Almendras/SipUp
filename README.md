### **_Description_**

##### SipUp is a juice bar application in where a user is able to order their juices of choice based on what juices are available. Once the user clicks on the drink they will be brought to the Juice Details Page in where they are able to select size, sugar level, qty, and any comments you'd like us to know about the order. Once they click 'Add to Order', the user can find their orders in the navigation section. There they can update an existing or delete the order all together.
